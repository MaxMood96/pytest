Added a :confval:`strict` configuration option to enable all strictness-related options.

When set to ``True``, the :confval:`strict` option currently enables :confval:`strict_config`,
:confval:`strict_markers`, :confval:`strict_xfail`, and :confval:`strict_parametrization_ids`.

The individual strictness options can be explicitly set to override the global :confval:`strict` setting.

If new strictness options are added in the future, they will also be automatically enabled by :confval:`strict`.
Therefore, we only recommend setting ``strict=True`` if you're using a locked version of pytest,
or if you want to proactively adopt new strictness options as they are added.
